# MACC Registration Waitlist

## Introduction
The MACC Registration Waitlist system is designed to manage course availability during registration periods. It allows students to join a waitlist for full courses and notifies them via email if spots become available. This document outlines the initial design specification for the system.

## System Overview
The MACC Registration Waitlist system consists of:
- User Interface: Web-based interface for students to view courses, join waitlists, and receive notifications.
- Database: Centralized database to store course information, student data, and waitlist status.
- Waitlist Algorithm: Prioritizes students on the waitlist based on first-come-first-served criteria.
- Notification System: Sends automated email notifications to students regarding waitlist status updates.
- Administrative Tools: Tools for administrators to manage course capacities and waitlists.

## System Architecture
The system will be built using a client-server architecture:
- **Client Side**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP.NET Core MVC Razor Pages, and Bootstrap for responsive design.
- **Server Side**: Python, C++, Visual Basic for backend scripting, processing, and compatibility.
- **Database**: MySQL for data storage and efficient query processing.

## Functional Requirements
- **Student Registration**: Students can register for courses and join waitlists for full courses.
- **Waitlist Management**: Automatically offers waitlist option, prioritizes students, and sends notifications.
- **Notification System**: Sends automated emails for waitlist updates.
- **Administrative Tools**: Manage course capacities, waitlists, and system configuration.

## Non-functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Efficient handling of concurrent requests and optimized database queries.
- **Security**: Proper authentication, authorization, and encryption of sensitive data.
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate future growth in enrollment and course offerings.

## System Interfaces
- **User Interface**: Web-based interface accessible on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Administrative Interface**: Dashboard for authorized personnel to monitor and manage the system.

## System Testing
- Granular testing to ensure functionality, performance, and security.
- Unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

## Conclusion
The MACC Registration Waitlist system aims to streamline course enrollment and enhance the student experience. By implementing efficient waitlist management algorithms, automated notifications, and intuitive interfaces, the system optimizes enrollment processes for both students and administrators.
